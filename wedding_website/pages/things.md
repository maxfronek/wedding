      Enoteca opened its doors in December of 2012 & caught on quick with its grand, wood-fired oven, 
      its made-to-order hand-tossed pizzas, & its open kitchen, where the chefs prepare Italian-influenced dishes such as asiago pesto meatballs & fresh house-made pasta courtesy of Mason Family Provisions.
      Enoteca boasts an extensive wine and beer list hand-selected by the knowledgable staff.
      We look forward to seeing you soon!

      One of Alyse & Max's favorite spots, Wrapcity serves up creative wraps and salads, homemade soups, and unique quesadillas. Stop in for daily wrap and soup specials or choose one of the popular wraps on the menu, and be sure to dine on the sidewalk patio with great views of Baldy. As the temperature rises, Wrapcity is the place to go for refreshing and healthy wraps.

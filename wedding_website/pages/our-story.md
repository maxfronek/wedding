      We met and fell in love in 2021 in beautiful Los Angeles. After a Hinge conversation full of laughs and getting-to-know you's (and Max taking way too long to make a move), we had our first date at [Ladybyrd](https://www.ladybyrdcafe.com){:target="_blank" data-tooltip="Weird cocktails. Good food. Slow service. Great date."} in Echo Park.

      Easy conversation and a lot of chemistry led to more and more dates. Picnics, drive-in movies, and [plenty of wine bars](https://www.tabularasabar.com/){:data-tooltip="LOVE Tabula" target="_blank"} all led to a deeper relationship. From weddings in Hood River (Hi Zach &amp; Kate!) to Christmas in Sun Valley (complete with travel delays and drives with Steve), our first year together was full of fun, adventure, and falling in love.

      Year two saw us moving in together, celebrating many special occasions, and of course adopting our furry child [Ellie](#){:target="_blank" data-tooltip="Yup, it's an album full of pictures of our dog. YOU'RE WELCOME."}. Though she put us through the wringer at first (including a parvo diagnosis on day 3 of having her and a postponed trip to Italy) she's also probably the thing we love most in life. Besides each other.

      As Christmas 2022 approached, Max knew he had an important question to ask. After some light planning with the co-maids of honor to find the perfect ring, he took Alyse to the [Roundhouse](#){:data-tooltip="Best fondue in the valley" target="_blank"} on Mt. Baldy for a fondue and champagne date, and popped the question in front of a view they'd first seen together a year before. (She said yes).

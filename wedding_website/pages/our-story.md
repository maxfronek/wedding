      We met and fell in love in 2021 in beautiful Los Angeles. After a Hinge conversation filled with laughter, getting-to-know you's, and Max taking way too long to make a move, we had our first date at [Ladybyrd](https://www.ladybyrdcafe.com){:target="_blank" data-tooltip="Weird cocktails. Good food. Slow service. Great date."} in Echo Park.

      Easy conversation and a lot of chemistry led to more and more dates. We enjoyed picnics, drive-in movies, and [plenty of wine bars](https://www.tabularasabar.com/){:data-tooltip="LOVE Tabula" target="_blank"} together, and even though it was still "early days" we knew it was the start of something special. Throughout our first year together, we celebrated with our friends, were each other's wedding dates(Hi Zach &amp; Kate and Ben &amp; Sommer!), celebrated our July birthdays, enjoyed Christmas in Sun Valley (complete with multi-day travel delays), and more. It's safe to say that our first year together was full of fun, adventure, and falling in love.

      Year two marked a significant milestone in our relationship as we decided to forgo our bachelor pads and move in together. Our love grew stronger during this time—not just through our shared love of [reality TV](https://www.bravotv.com/){:data-tooltip="Thanks Andy Cohen!" target="_blank"})—but also because we welcomed our furry child Ellie into our lives. Although she put us through the wringer at first—including a parvo diagnosis right after we rescued her—she's also probably the thing we love most in life. Besides each other, of course.

      As Christmas 2022 approached, Max knew he'd found the love of his love (and Alyse was pretty sure, too). After planning with the co-maids of honor to find the perfect ring, he took Alyse to the [Roundhouse](https://www.sunvalley.com/dining/the-roundhouse/){:data-tooltip="Best fondue in the valley" target="_blank"} on Mt. Baldy for a fondue and champagne date. There he popped the question in front of a view of snow-capped mountains they'd first seen together a year before. Spoiler - she said yes.

      We met and fell in love in 2021 in beautiful Los Angeles. After a Hinge conversation full of laughs and getting-to-know you's, and Max taking way too long to make a move, we had our first date at [Ladybyrd](https://www.ladybyrdcafe.com){:target="_blank" data-tooltip="Weird cocktails. Good food. Slow service. Great date."} in Echo Park.

      Easy conversation and a lot of chemistry led to more and more dates. Picnics, drive-in movies, and [plenty of wine bars](https://www.tabularasabar.com/){:data-tooltip="LOVE Tabula" target="_blank"} were the start of something special, even though it was still early days. From weddings in Hood River (Hi Zach &amp; Kate!), birthdays celebrated together, Christmas in Sun Valley (complete with multi-day travel delays), and more, our first year together was full of fun, adventure, and falling in love.

      Year two saw us move in together, growing closer (and not just through our shared love of [reality TV](https://www.bravotv.com/){:data-tooltip="Thanks Andy Cohen!" target="_blank"}) and of course adopting our furry child Ellie. Though she put us through the wringer at first—including a parvo diagnosis right after we rescued her—she's also probably the thing we love most in life. Besides each other.

      As Christmas 2022 approached, Max knew he'd found the love of his love (and Alyse was pretty sure, too). After planning with the co-maids of honor to find the perfect ring, he took Alyse to the [Roundhouse](https://www.sunvalley.com/dining/the-roundhouse/){:data-tooltip="Best fondue in the valley" target="_blank"} on Mt. Baldy for a fondue and champagne date, and popped the question in front of a view they'd first seen together a year before. (She said yes).

      Since then we've had a whirlwind of planning, trips, parties, and fun. We can't wait for you to join us as we make it official in one of our favorite places, with our favorite people. The only thing we ask is you come ready to have fun and get on the dance floor!

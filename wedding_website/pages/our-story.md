      We met and fell in love in 2021 in beautiful Los Angeles. After a Hinge conversation full of laughs and getting-to-know you's (and Max taking way too long to set up an actual date), we had our first date at [Ladybyrd](https://www.ladybyrdcafe.com){:target="_blank" data-tooltip="Good food. Better cocktails. Slow service."} in Echo Park.

      Easy conversation and a lot of chemistry led to more and more dates. Picnics, drive-in movies, and [plenty of wine bars](https://www.tabularasabar.com/){:data-tooltip="LOVE Tabula" target="_blank"} all led to a deeper relationship. From weddings in Hood River (Hi Zach &amp; Kate!) to Christmas in Sun Valley (complete with travel delays and drives with Steve), our first year together was full of fun, adventure, and falling in love.

      There are plenty of ways to get to Sun Valley! Here's a few of our recommendations, depending on your preferred method of travel. Just remember: <strong>There's no Uber or Lyft in Sun Valley, and taxis are hard to come by. A rental car is strongly recommended.</strong> We will have shuttle service to and from the venue, but if you miss the shuttle, you'll need to make friends with someone with a car.

      Max has known Melissa since they day he set foot in Los Angeles. From their first trip to [Porto's together](https://portosbakery.com/){:data-tooltip="He's still thankful for that introduction, especially the potato croquette and medianoche sandwich" target="_blank"} they became fast friends, in no small part thanks to Melissa's excellent ability to give the perfect piece of advice at any time (and also find the best parking spot). Through tons of experiences, from finding the perfect midcentury furniture to resume and job interview coaching, walking through Dia de los Muertos festivals and Melissa's engagement photoshoot, their friendship has grown and grown. After living together in West Hollywood, Max and Melissa established an even closer bond that can only be described as "roombas". He's so happy to have her standing up there as he starts the next part of his life.

      Max met Raj on the beach before he'd even moved to LA, and they quickly bonded over a shared love of music and travel. From Iceland and Alaska to closer trips like Joshua Tree, they've seen a good slice of the world together and Raj's sense of humor has kept them laughing all the way. Now, even their dogs are friends.

      Max met KJ when he crashed a Santa Barbara anniversary trip between KJ and his wife, Elizabeth. Even though that was pretty rude, the two of them quickly bonded over a shared love of great beers and the Green Bay Packers. As KJ tried in vain to help Max's fantasy team (some things just can't be saved) their bond grew. Through a trip to Japan and KJ starting his family, they've kept their bond strong.

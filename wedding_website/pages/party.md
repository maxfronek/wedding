      Maggie Dausavage has been a consistently vibrant force in Alyse's life since they met over ten years ago (right after Alyse moved to LA).  Even though Maggie made the mistake of [buying her sunflowers](https://www.epipen.com/en){:data-tooltip="ALLERGIES! Bring the epi-pen"} early on, they became fast friends. They shared countless mimosa-fueled brunches along with nights out where neither wanted to call itâ€”theyâ€™re pretty similar that way. 

      Maggie's infectious energy lights up every room she enters, and even though everyone has to share her with her new baby, Maya, itâ€™s OK. Alyse was honored to be a part of her wedding day, and is thrilled to have her return the favor as she embarks on her own journey.

      Hannah and Alyse met while attending college at Montana State. They were both in the film program, but Hannah was cooler and a grade ahead, so their friendship really began when they lived near each other in Brooklyn. When they moved to LA, it really took off.

      Hannah is an incredibly creative and kind soul; depending on the moment she can make anyone laugh or dive into a deep philosophical conversation. Alyse and Hannah have danced the night away during rooftop parties in NY, seen the country during camping trips and wine tours, and toasted many nights together watching The Bachelor or Bachelorette. Hereâ€™s to another night of dancing and laughing together!

    heading: Adelaide Smithmason

      Adelaide and Alyse danced together growing up, and even though Adelaide was always the teacher's favorite, the two of them always had many laughs walking to [dance class](#){:data-tooltip="PEN15"}. Adelaide has always been fearless and taken risks, like spending a year abroad in Italy while the rest of us were in boring regular high school.

      Though there's a lot more distance between them these days, and Adelaide's busy running [Sun Valley's best Italian restaurant](https://www.ketchum-enoteca.com/){:data-tooltip="Enoteca!" target="_blank"} and raising her chickens, they still enjoy every second they can get together. Alyse has been overjoyed to watch Adelaide become a wife and a mom, and can't wait to have her standing with her on the big day.

    heading: Melissa Sanchez
    role: Best Mel

      Max has known Melissa since they day he set foot in Los Angeles. From their first trip to [Porto's together](https://portosbakery.com/){:data-tooltip="He's still thankful for that introduction, especially the potato croquette and medianoche sandwich" target="_blank"} they became fast friends, in no small part thanks to Melissa's excellent ability to give the perfect piece of advice at any time (and also find the best parking spot). Through tons of experiences, from finding the perfect midcentury furniture to resume and job interview coaching, walking through Dia de los Muertos festivals and Melissa's engagement photoshoot, their friendship has grown and grown. After living together in West Hollywood, Max and Melissa established an even closer bond that can only be described as "roombas". He's so happy to have her standing up there as he starts the next part of his life.

      Max met Raj on the beach before he'd even moved to LA, and they quickly bonded over a shared love of music and travel. From Iceland and Alaska to closer trips like Joshua Tree, they've seen a good slice of the world together and Raj's sense of humor has kept them laughing all the way. Now, even their dogs are friends.

    heading: KJ Hanna

      Max met KJ when he crashed a Santa Barbara anniversary trip between KJ and his wife, Elizabeth. Despite the rude start, the two of them quickly bonded over a shared love of great beers and the Green Bay Packers. As KJ tried in vain to help Max's fantasy team (some things just can't be saved) their bond grew and their freindship became stronger. 
      
      Through long nights of great food, an eipc trip to Japan, and KJ starting his family, they've kept their friendship strong. Max is excited to have KJ standing next to him as he and Alyse start their life together.

    heading: Sophia Dilley

        Sophia and Alyse go way, way back â€“ we're talking elementary school dance classes, where their collective lack of grace meant they were forever banished to the back row and pink outfits. Yet, their shining moment emerged when they took the stage as Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, tapping their way into the hearts of everyone in the audience!

        Their friendship has been a wild ride, filled with endless nights and weekends spent at each other's childhood homes, perfecting the fine art of prank calling and creating ridiculous home videos (remember the I.N. ðŸ™‚). Alyse has always admired Sophia's unstoppable drive and sense of humor, and promises <strong>never</strong> to tell anyone about their early 2000's reenactments of music [videos](#){:data-tooltip="Whoops"}.

    heading: Samantha Fronek

      Max has known Sam his whole life, and even though she says things were better before he came around, that's probably not true. Through family vacations and Christmas board games, refusing to buy Max beer when he was in high school, and road trips through California, Iceland, and beyond, Sam's been the perfect example of a big sister.

      Though they live thousands of miles apart, Sam's just a phone call away for a reassuring word, Jeff Goldblum joke, or just a chat. Max is so happy she can be part of today and hopes she won't share too many embarrassing childhood stories.
